  **...no one knows why the stone had to be rolled up the mountain.**

  Objects, Video and Photographs, 1998–2000.

  Among other objects, this series of works consists of a video projection showing a 6 year old girl trying to follow the simple request to stand still in front of the camera. The girl is evolving her own strategy of how to go about fulfilling this request. She lingers between a strict self-discipline, and a precarious eye contact with the camera. Next to the video projection is a ball of child’s plasticine, slowly deforming due to its weight, and assuming a new form. The materiality of the ball corresponds to the reaction of the girl in the video: in both cases they are responding to an external force by re-forming themselves.
