  From 2012 to 2018 I was a professor of art education at the Hamburg state academy of Higher Artistic and Scientific Education, HFBK Hamburg.

  In my teaching, I created a transfer space where students could contribute their knowledge from artistic classes, scientific seminars and the didactics of university, and relate them to each other. The different logics, interests and modes of action of the respective disciplines became visible and the contradiction that arises when one moves in the fields of art and education became open and negotiable.

  An important impulse for my teaching was the questioning of learning itself. Under the buzzwords Ver-Lernen and Nicht-Wissen (to unlearn and not knowing) inspired by Gayatri Spivak's postcolonial critique, I established a curriculum in which workshops, seminars, and excursions were concerned with questioning dominant forms of learning and knowledge and developing alternative approaches to thought and work.
