  The Clara Grunwald School in Hamburg Neuallermöhe is an all-day primary school attended by children with 30 mother tongues. Central to the engaged school management’s pedagogical approach are project classes for mixed age groups. 

  The entrance hall of the school is the centre of the school, but it serves mainly as just a passageway.

  We were approached by the school and asked to develop designs for the entrance hall to better support their pedagogical concept.

  In this project with designers and students of the HFBK Hamburg we asked the question how can we gather ideas from (in some cases, pre-literate) pupils and teachers to inform the design concepts.

  What followed was a program of idea workshops and discussions with pupils and teachers, where they sketched their proposals. These sketches were fed into a Ideensauger (idea hoover) machine which scanned and presented their ideas, legitimising all contributions. Subsequently these ideas formed the input to workable designs for a new use for this space, which were developed as scaled 3D models and exhibited in the entrance hall.

  With: Lea Kissing, Till Richter, Johanna Padge (Designer) and the students of HFBK Anna-Lena Cychy, Zorha Teheri, Ajdan Aslonova, Lea Kirstein, Lukas Sonnemann, Leonie Frenzel, Lisa Eggert, Elisabeth Moch
