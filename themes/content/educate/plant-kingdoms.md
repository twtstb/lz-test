  Maria Sybilla Merian was an unconventional artist and naturalist, who was able to make important discoveries in the Baroque period through precise observations. What if we were to discover a plant world in an undiscovered area or on a planet today?

  After an insight into the artistic production of Maria Sybilla Merian, 7th graders documented the flora and fauna of an imaginary world.
