  Jet was an independent exhibition space for the discussion and presentation of artistic and curatorial practices which I founded in 2005 and operated until 2010 at Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Once a year artists and curators from various disciplines developed their own focus on a particular theme which they related to Jet's physical exhibition space resulting in a series of 6-8 exhibitions running throughout that year. In addition to these themed exhibition series, I also invited selected individual artists to show their work.
