  Over the 80 years of her life, Chris Reinecke has passed through various phases of artistic production. Each phase has entailed new forms of expression, sometimes intimately bound up with sociopolitical activism. At the same time, though, the individual phases are also linked by an internal logic that can be traced independently of social developments. The purpose of this exhibition was to place the various phases of Reinecke’s career side by side and on an equal footing, thus highlighting an original and distinctive artistic position that has heretofore gone largely unnoticed. 

  As part of the 2008 exhibition series Abenteurer / adventurers at JET I curated the first retrospective of Düsseldorf artist Chris Reinecke, collecting works from 1955 to the present.  


  Accompanying the exhibition I also produced a catalogue (ISBN: 978-3-9812552-7-0) with texts by Hans-Jürgen Hafner and me, designed by Gestaltungswillen
