  The series of exhibitions and concerts entitled Fehler (Failure/Error/Mistake) questioned the manifestation of Fehler and their characterisation within society, considered not as a breach of the rules but as a positive instruction for action. In a variety of ways, a range of phenomena associated with Fehler were put to productive use, and there was an affirmation and embracing of faulty material.

  This series was conducted with the collaboration of Vera Tollmann, Danh Vo, Boris Baltschun, Doreen Mende and Achim Lengerer for Jet. The “catalogue” of the Fehler series consists of six posters in one folder. The posters were produced without proofreading, by the artist Pratchaya Phinthong in Thailand using the cyanotype process.

  With posters by Heike Bollig, Achim Lengerer, Doreen Mende, Lucy Powell, Sabine Sanio, Danh Vo.
