  How can we take the paradoxical qualities of artworks whose substance oscillates, like a Möbius strip, between both this and that, and translate them into the medium of the book? And how might it be possible to present illustrations of these works in the book format without allowing the book design to overshadow them?

  I developed the design concept for the catalogue, and co-curated the exhibition Untitled (Ohne Titel) as a member of the Realismusstudio at NGBK. 

  The catalog represents an attempt to translate into the book medium the swing of the pendulum between this and that. Its design amplifies the reader’s uncertainty as to the difference between front and back, inside and outside. It thus becomes a puzzle of a book that includes its exterior and excludes its interior. Not its content, but rather its form becomes an ambiguous figure. While it can still be read in linear fashion, it nonetheless undermines the categories of front, back, inside and outside. In this way, the book underscores the thinking behind the works represented in it.

  With artworks by: Trisha Donnelly, Famed, Friederike Feldmann, Andrea Fraser, Peter Friedl, Ull Hohn, Karl Holmqvist, Lousie Lawler, Kirsten Pieroth, Karin Sander.

  Curated by: Christin Lahr, Frank Wagner, Lena Ziese for NGBK, Berlin
