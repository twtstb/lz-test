  New Patrons are people who want to make positive change. They hire artists to develop works of art that propose answers to urgent questions in their city, town, or village. With support from mediators, they define what they want from art and initiate projects that articulate what matters to them.

  New Patrons is an international network based on the idea of the artist Fran√ßois Hers.
