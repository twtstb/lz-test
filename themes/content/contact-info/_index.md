*We have no art, we do everything as well as we can* â€“ Corita Kent


Lena Ziese focusses on the intersection of art and education, negotiating the potential of art and its translation into social contexts. Trained as an artist and art educator her artistic practice has increasingly become a hybrid art-mediating practice, of which this website shows selected examples. 

She is the founder of the **Jet exhibition space** which she operated for five years at Alexanderplatz, Berlin.

She has held professorships at **Bauhaus University, Weimar** (Fine Art, Design, and its mediation) and most recently at **HFBK Hamburg** (Art education) 2012-2018. 

She is currently working as a mediator for the New Patrons network.
