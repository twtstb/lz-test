  The three artworks The Mind is a Muscle by Yvonne Rainer, Product of Circumstances by Xavier Le Roy and Abecedarium Bestarium by Antonia Baehr formed the starting point for three workshops developed at the HFBK Hamburg together with dancer Anna Till and dance scientist Cindy Denner.

  The discussion focused on questions of the performativity of movement, the moment of liveness in dance and fine arts, and the relationship between audience and performer. Perspectives from the visual arts and pedagogy met perspectives from contemporary dance. Acting between the disciplines led to three multi-perspective considerations of the pieces, which combined a knowledge of the body with a knowledge about the body as a medium in the arts.

  The publication to think, to say, to do one thing gives an insight into the workshops.

  With texts by Cindy Denner, Anna Till and Lena Ziese. Design: Anna Bertermann and Matthias Meyer. ISBN 978-3-944954-39-4
