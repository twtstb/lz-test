  What is it that drives 12 to 14 year old teens and how would they explain what is important to them? In this project, I flipped the conventional teacher teaches pupils approach on its head. I tasked 7th graders to develop tutorial videos of topics they are passionate about and spend a lot of their time on. Common themes of the videos were: Fortnite, Instagram, sports and Apple products.
