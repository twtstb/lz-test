How can artistic practices be translated into an exhibition space? What gets lost, what new contexts emerge? How do exhibitions tell stories differently from books?

I founded and ran the Jet exhibition space at Alexanderplatz, Berlin where I collaborated with artists and scientists to develop annual exhibition series for Jet's physical space. Since then I have been active as a curator for different institutions.
