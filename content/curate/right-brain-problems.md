  Together with Susanne Weiss I curated the exhibition Right Brain Problems at Heidelberger Kunstverein. The exhibition linked the first European, institutional solo exhibition of Stuart Sherman (1945-2001) with contemporary artists who are connected to his work in various ways. The American performer and filmmaker was part of the avantgarde scene of artists, theater- and filmmakers in New York in the 1970s and 80s. He presented his art – small-scaled, obsessive and headstrong – mostly in places beyond the art establishment.
