  "Lena Ziese has collected newspaper photographs of prominent politicians, business people and celebrities. Reduced to nonverbal communication, the deliberate and practiced poses and gestures emerge all the more clearly in these snapshots. Superiority, confidence, reserve: How do these figures present themselves? And what conventions does the photographer bring to the picture? How is the photo editor trying to represent the person? And how do the headlines influence our perception of the image? Lena Ziese exploits these constantly reproduced pictorial conventions, placing them side by side to outrageous effect. She especially enjoys deviations from the rules of image politics, which both break and validate convention. These are especially useful for creating tiny shifts in the regulatory system of press photos and setting an alternative narrative in motion."
